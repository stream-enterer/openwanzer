Contributing To Arcade
======================

We would love to have you contribute to the project!

Arcade's powerful features and documentation couldn't
exist without help and contributions from users like you.

Contributing Code
-----------------

If you are interested in contributing code, please check out the `Github Contributing Guide`_

I Can't Code Yet
----------------
Even as a complete beginner, there are several ways you can help.

Tell Us About Documentation Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Let us know if anything's off or hard to follow about this
documentation.

It doesn't matter whether you've started :ref:`the platformer tutorial <platformer_tutorial>`
or just happen to be looking around. Let us know if anything looks off.

The best ways to report it are via `Discord <Arcade Discord>`_
or the `Arcade GitHub`_ repository, but we also have other
:ref:`community-locations`.

To be clear, all of the following are worth reporting:

* Accessibility issues such as poor contrast or readability
* Mistakes in spelling or grammar mistakes
* Poorly written or hard to read material
* Incorrect or outdated information
* Odd behavior in styles or UI
* Broken links

Play Games made with Arcade
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Arcade users often participate in game jams. Helping them
is as easy as:

#. Playing their games
#. Providing feedback via the game jam's comments

That includes reporting bugs on their projects to help them improve.

Create Art, Music, and Sound
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you're an artist or a musician, you can build your skills
through game jams or game asset communities.

* `The Python Discord`_ hosts team formation and more for the `PyWeek`_ game jam
* `OpenGameArt.org <https://opengameart.org/>`_ is a long-running game asset community
* Various pixel art communities exist on Discord and Reddit

Report Bugs
-----------

If you see something weird, let the devs know!

Whether it's via `GitHub <GitHub Issue List>`_ or the `Arcade Discord`_,
even a simple screenshot or video capture can help us make Arcade better.
This includes:

* Crashes on launch or any other time
* Odd behavior in Arcade's examples
* Functions not working correctly


Excellent Bug Reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The best bug reports are specific and repeatable.

The following steps helps us fix bugs faster by making it easier to find
the source of the problem.

#. Note your :ref:`Python and Arcade versions <help-basic-environment-info>`
#. Try to figure out when and how to make the bug happen

   * Remember: this can be hard, and that's okay
   * If you can't put it into words, any of the following can help!

     * Screenshots or video recordings
     * Error traceback
     * Example code that makes the problem happen

#. Search the `GitHub Issue List`_ for anything similar

   * If it exists, comment
   * If not, post a new one

Don't worry too much about posting duplicates. We can always cross-reference
issues if it's a duplicate. If you're unsure, you can always ask on `Discord <Arcade Discord>`_.
