Arcade offers experimental support for video playback through :py:mod:`pyglet` and other libraries.

.. warning:: These features are works-in-progress!

   Please the following to learn more:

   * :ref:`future_api`
   * The undocumented `experimental folder <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/tree/development/arcade/experimental>`_

To make testing easier, Arcade includes the small video file embedded below. However, runnign the
examples below may require installing both :ref:`guide-supportedmedia-ffmpeg` and additional libraries:

* The `cv2-based video examples <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/blob/development/arcade/future/video/>`_
* The `cv2-based shadertoy example <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/blob/development/arcade/experimental/shadertoy_video_cv2.py>`_

The links above use the unstable development branch of Arcade to gain access to the latest :py:mod:`pyglet`
and Arcade features. If you have questions or want to help develop these examples further, we'd love to hear
from you. The Arcade `Discord server <Arcade Discord>`_ and `GitHub repository <Arcade GitHub>`_ always welcome
new community members.
