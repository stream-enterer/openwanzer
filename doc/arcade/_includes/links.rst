.. pending: post-3.0 cleanup:
.. We try to include this thing in the rst_prolog in conf.py through ugly means
.. adding the lines doesn't help with the generated resources, nor am I in the mood
.. to clean it up right now. If it builds and looks nice, it ships. PDF comes later.

.. Do not include the following here:
.. 1. the pyglet doc (use :py:mod:`pyglet` / etc to auto-link the right version)
.. 2. links to files in the Arcade GitHub repo (use the conf.py + base URLs) (See https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/2387)
